# Iris flower species predictor

A project that predicts the species of an iris flower could be based on its physical measurments.

The programming language used is python v3.13.5.
This project uses linear regression from scikit-learn library and pandas library.

The model is trained from the famous Fisher's Iris dataset (1936). <br>

Predictions are based on: <br> 
sepal length (cm) <br>
sepal width(cm) <br>
petal length (cm) <br>
petal width (cm)

The model predicts a number corresponding to the species: <br>
0: Iris Setosa <br>
1: Iris Versicolor <br>
2: Iris Verginica <br>
else: Unknown species <br>
